This is my first personal portfolio which I designed in Figma and built with HTML and CSS (no frameworks).

The user can navigate to different sections of the page and find links to projects.

This project was used as an opportunity to practise my CSS skills (Grid, Custom Properties and Resets), with the theme and design being inspired by Britanny Chiang (https://brittanychiang.com/) and Lapix (https://www.lapix.jp/)
